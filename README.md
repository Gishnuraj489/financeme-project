🚀 Banking and Finance Domain - DevOps Implementation  

📌 Problem Statement  

Traditional banking and finance applications face several challenges:  

 ❌ Complex monolithic architectures make development difficult.  
 ❌ Manual testing of components/modules slows down the process.  
 ❌ Incremental builds are hard to manage, test, and deploy.  
 ❌ Scaling individual modules independently isn't possible.  
 ❌ Setting up infrastructure manually is time-consuming.  
 ❌ Continuous monitoring requires significant manual effort.  

✅ Our Solution  

By leveraging **DevOps practices,** we have transformed the development, deployment, and monitoring processes.  

🔹 Key Implementations  

✅ **Microservices Architecture** - Breaking the monolith into scalable, independent services.  
✅ **CI/CD Pipelines** - Automating builds, testing, and deployments.  
✅ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** - Automating infrastructure provisioning with tools like Terraform.  
✅ **Containerization** - Using Docker for efficient application deployment and scaling.  
✅ **Automated Monitoring** - Implementing tools like Prometheus & Grafana for real-time tracking.  

 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  

- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub  
- **CI/CD:** Jenkins
- **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker 
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform, Ansible
